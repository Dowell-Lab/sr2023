<h1>Short Read Workshop Day 1</h1>
The goal of the first day is to get oriented to the class, the AWS super computer, and sequencing data. We will present an overview of the course and discuss the basic principles of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and subsequent steps involved in processing this data (analysis pipelines). We will confirm that everyone can access the AWS instance and begin learning basic Bash, Git/GitHub, and the VIM text editor.
