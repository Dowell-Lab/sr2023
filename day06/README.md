2. In RStudio 

- `Learning_R.R` R script

3. Submitting and R script as an sbatch job

- `Learning_R_submit_aws.R` R script
- `Submit_Rscript.sbatch` sbatch script calling the `Learning_R_submit_aws.R` R script

## Homework

1. Both homeworks can be done in R Studion

- `Learning_R_Additional_Practice.R`
- `Day6_rscript_homework_2023.R`

2. Additional homework is to install R packages we will use later in the week. Both packages can be found on bioconductor.
