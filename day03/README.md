# Day 3 | Intro to Servers, Public Data & Quality Control

The goal of day 3 is to move to super computer thinking. Therefore, today we will learn the basics of high-performance computing, servers, and job/workload managers. It is also important to know how to access public data and transfer this data to and from the server and how to run some basic quality control. Today we start using real data! We will evaluate your sequencing data for its quality. Remember: Garbage In, Garbage out. It is never worth your time to try to analyze garbage.
