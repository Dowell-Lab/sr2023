First you willl need to log into the AWS andfollow:
 Day7_installing_Rsubread.docx
 Day7_featurecounts_worksheet.docx

We are on the AWS because Day7_featurecounts_worksheet.docx requires the bam files.

Then you will need to log off the AWS to do 
Day7_differential_expression_worksheet.doc

It is easier to use Deseq2 on your own computer with Rstudio and the counts file you need for input is very small. 

If you get both of these worksheets done you can go to the scripts folder of day 7 and look inside the routin directory. It has another way to count using feature counts. What are the pros and cons of this other way?
