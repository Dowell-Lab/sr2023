First you willl need to log into the AWS andfollow:
 Day7_installing_Rsubread.docx
 Day7_featurecounts_worksheet.docx

We are on the AWS because Day7_featurecounts_worksheet.docx requires the bam files.

Then you will need to log off the AWS to do 
Day7_differential_expression_worksheet.doc

It is easier to use Deseq2 on your own computer with Rstudio and the counts file you need for input is very small.
