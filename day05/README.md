# Day 5 | Assessment

Today it's about catching up and making sure we are ready for next week! We will use for loops to process multiple FASTQ files to compressed visualization files. We will also take a quick assessment to make sure everyone is comfortable with the first week of the workshop. We will give you a short task which should ideally take less than two hours to complete. If it takes longer, it is a good idea to go home over the weekend and review/practice skills from the first week. The second week will be at a much quicker pace!
