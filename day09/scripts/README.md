# Short Read Day 9: Peak-centric scripts
- Author: Jessica Huynh-Westfall

The scripts for today's module will be focusing on peak-centric sequencing data. Briefly, the scripts in the directory will help you evaluate your sequencing data, quality control using input or blacklist regions for sequencing data, call peaks in your data, motif discovery and visualizing your data.

1. d9_fastqc.sbatch - Run fastQC on your sequencing data
2. d9_hisat2.sbatch - Alignment of data to reference genome
3. d9_preseq.sbatch & d9_multiqc.sbatch - QC
4. d9_macs.sbatch - Peak calling
