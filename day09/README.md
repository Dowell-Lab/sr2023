# Day 9 | ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq & Peak Calling

Today we will continue on data analysis on peak-centric sequencing methods. We will cover the basics analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data. We will look at how to use MACS2 for peak calling, optimizing peak calling by incorporating blacklist regions, and different setting parameters depending on data type.
