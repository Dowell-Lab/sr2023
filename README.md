This repository is for a biodata science course created by the DnA Labs (Dowell and Allen) at the Univiersiy of Colorado Boulder. This course will teach the basics of RNA-seq anaysis using a super computer and the bash language. The course will also teach a small amount of R. This course assumes you will use a super computer for anaysis.
