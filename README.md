This github repository holds the scripts and files for the 2023 Short Read Analysis Workshop, a biodata science course created by the DnA Labs (Dowell and Allen) at the University of Colorado Boulder. This course will teach the basics of RNA-seq anaysis using a super computer and the bash language, as well as a small amount of R. This course assumes you will use a super computer for anaysis.
