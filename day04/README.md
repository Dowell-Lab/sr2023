# Day 4 | Trimming, Mapping & IGV (Genome Browser Visualization)

Congrats! It is time to now do some real data analysis! Today we will do more quality control and learn about mapping and visualization. These are the first steps that take place after obtaining your sequencing data. It is important to determine whether your sequencing experiment is successful before moving on to downstream analyses.
